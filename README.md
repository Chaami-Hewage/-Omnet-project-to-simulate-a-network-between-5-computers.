# OMNeT++ Network Simulation Project

This project demonstrates a simple network simulation using OMNeT++. It includes a network of computers that exchange messages. Each computer has a specific role in the message exchange.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

- `src/`: Contains the OMNeT++ simulation source code.
- `simulations/`: Contains configuration files and simulation results.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `LICENSE`: The project's license file.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this Git repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/omnetpp-network-simulation.git
   ```

2. **Install OMNeT++:** Ensure that you have OMNeT++ installed on your system. You can download it from [the OMNeT++ website](https://omnetpp.org/download/).

3. **Build the Project:** Open the OMNeT++ IDE and import this project. Build the project to compile the simulation code.

4. **Run the Simulation:** Configure and run the simulation using the OMNeT++ IDE. You can specify simulation parameters in the `omnetpp.ini` file.

5. **View Results:** After running the simulation, check the simulation results and output in the `simulations/` directory.

## Customizing the Simulation

You can customize the simulation by modifying the network description (NED) file and C++ source files in the `src/` directory. Be sure to update the NED file if you change the network topology.
